# ColorSortingMachine

## Description:
This application is a side-project for [Color-Story](https://github.com/Mleuer/Color-Story). This ColorSortingMachine allows for a user to input values for RGB colors, and see how this RGB value is categorized. Color categories are as follows:
* red (which includes pink)
* orange
* yellow
* green
* cyan
* blue
* purple
* magenta
* black
* white
* gray

## Usage:
Open the application (https://craindavis.github.io/ColorSortingMachine/) and do the following steps:
* __step 1:__ Input a value for red, one for green, and one for blue in the respective input fields. All values should be positive integers between 0 and 255.
* __step 2:__ Click the "go" button. This will render the box on the bottom-left to display the RGB value as a color. On the bottom right, there will be two sections to take note of:
    * the user's input in RGB color code format
    * the category it belongs to based on the algorithm
